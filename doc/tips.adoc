== Tips

If you work with many chains, the following function can be added to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`.

NOTE: You need to have https://github.com/junegunn/fzf[fzf] installed and `subrpc` v0.0.4+ installed.

[source, bash]
----
include::subopen.sh[lines=2..-1]
----

Call the function invoking simply `subopen`. Type the name of a chain, it can be approximate, for instance `river`, then press enter.
